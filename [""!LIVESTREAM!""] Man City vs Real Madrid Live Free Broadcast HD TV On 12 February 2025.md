The UEFA Champions League knockout phase is set to kick off with an exciting match as Brest will host Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday in the first leg of the playoff tie.


The hosts were one of the five teams that debuted this season in the Champions League tournament and qualified for the playoff round with just 13 points from their league phase. They will enter this contest after picking up two consecutive victories, 2-1 and 2-0, over Troyes and Nantes in their recent encounters in Round 21 of Ligue 1.

PSG, on the other hand, has become an unstoppable force in the competition. Starting the campaign with just a single victory in their first five outings, they bounced back and clinched three back-to-back victories to qualify for the playoffs. They defeated Monaco 4-1 in their latest encounter in Ligue 1.

Other than these two players, PSG do not have any fresh injury concerns going into this match. Georgian midfielder Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is likely to make his Champions League debut against Brest.

Manchester City vs Real Madrid prediction Looking at the track record of both teams in the head-to-head contest, PSG has always dominated the Brest side. But looking at the recent improved performance of the hosts, especially after their humiliating 2-5 defeat against PSG in Round 20 of Ligue 1, is commendable.

However, Brest can trouble their opponents with their starting goal; otherwise, PSG is almost confirmed to walk away with another easy win.

Prediction: PSG 3-1 Brest
